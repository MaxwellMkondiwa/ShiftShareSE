\title{Inference in an IV regression with a shift-share instrument}
\usage{
ivBartik.fit(y1, y2, X, W, Z, w = NULL, method = c("akm", "akm0"),
  beta0 = 0, alpha = 0.05, region_cvar = NULL, sector_cvar = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{y1}{Outcome variable, vector of length \code{N}}

\item{y2}{Endogenous variable, vector of length \code{N}}

\item{X}{Shift-share vector with length \code{N} of sectoral shocks,
aggregated to regional level using the share matrix \code{W}.}

\item{W}{A matrix of sector shares, so that \code{W[i, s]} corresponds to
share of sector \code{s} in region \code{i}}

\item{Z}{Matrix of regional controls, matrix with \code{N} rows}

\item{w}{vector of weights (length \code{N}) to be used in the fitting
process. If not \code{NULL}, weighted least squares is used with weights
\code{w}, i.e., \code{sum(w * residuals^2)} is minimized.}

\item{method}{Vector specifying which inference methods to use. The vector
    elements have to be one or more of the following strings:

\describe{

\item{\code{"homosk"}}{Assume i.i.d. homoskedastic errors}

\item{\code{"ehw"}}{Eicker-Huber-White standard errors}

\item{\code{"region_cluster"}}{Standard errors clustered at regional level}

\item{\code{"akm"}}{Adão-Kolesár-Morales}

\item{\code{"akm0"}}{Adão-Kolesár-Morales with null imposed. Note the
reported standard error for this method corresponds to the normalized
standard error, given by the length of the confidence interval divided by
\eqn{2z_{1-\alpha/2}}{2z_{1-alpha/2}}}

\item{\code{"all"}}{All of the methods above}}}

\item{beta0}{null that is tested (only affects reported p-values)}

\item{alpha}{Determines confidence level of reported confidence intervals,
which will have coverage \code{1-alpha}.}

\item{region_cvar}{A vector with length \code{N} of cluster variables, for
method \code{"cluster_region"}. If the vector \code{1:N} is used,
clustering is effectively equivalent to \code{ehw}}

\item{sector_cvar}{A vector with length \code{S} of cluster variables, if
sectors are to be clustered, for methods \code{"akm"} and \code{"akm0"}.
If the vector \code{1:S} is used, this is equivalent to not clustering.}
}
\description{
Basic computing engine to calculate confidence intervals and p-values in an
instrumental variables regression with a shift-share instrument, using
different inference methods, as specified by \code{method}.
