\title{Inference in an IV regression with Bartik structure}
\usage{
ivBartik(formula, data, subset, weights, Xs, W, method, beta0 = 0,
  alpha = 0.05, region_cvar = NULL, sector_cvar = NULL,
  residual_sector = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{object of class \code{"formula"} (or one that can be coerced
to that class) of the form \code{outcome ~ controls | endogenous_regressor}}

\item{data}{optional data frame, list or environment (or object coercible by
\code{as.data.frame} to a data frame) containing the outcome and running
variables in the model. If not found in \code{data}, the variables are
taken from \code{environment(formula)}, typically the environment from
which the function is called.}

\item{subset}{optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be used
in the fitting process.}

\item{weights}{an optional vector of weights to be used in the fitting
process. Should be \code{NULL} or a numeric vector. If non-\code{NULL},
weighted least squares is used with weights \code{weights} (that is,
minimizing \code{sum(weights*residuals^2)}); otherwise ordinary least squares is used.}

\item{Xs}{A vector of sector-level shocks / shifters.}

\item{W}{A matrix of sector shares, so that \code{W[i, s]} corresponds to
share of sector \code{s} in region \code{i}}

\item{method}{Vector specifying which inference methods to use. The vector
    elements have to be one or more of the following strings:

\describe{

\item{\code{"homosk"}}{Assume i.i.d. homoskedastic errors}

\item{\code{"ehw"}}{Eicker-Huber-White standard errors}

\item{\code{"region_cluster"}}{Standard errors clustered at regional level}

\item{\code{"akm"}}{Adão-Kolesár-Morales}

\item{\code{"akm0"}}{Adão-Kolesár-Morales with null imposed}

\item{\code{"all"}}{All of the methods above}},}

\item{beta0}{null that is tested (only affects reported p-values)}

\item{alpha}{Determines confidence level of reported confidence intervals,
which will have coverage \code{1-alpha}.}

\item{region_cvar}{A vector with length \code{N} of cluster variables, for
method \code{"cluster_region"}. If the vector \code{1:N} is used,
clustering is effectively equivalent to \code{ehw}}

\item{sector_cvar}{A vector with length \code{S} of cluster variables, if
sectors are to be clustered, for methods \code{"akm"} and \code{"akm0"}.
If the vector \code{1:S} is used, this is equivalent to not clustering.}

\item{residual_sector}{If the sectors do not sum to one, should a dummy
residual sector be created?}
}
\description{
Computes confidence intervals and p-values in an instrumental variables
regression in which the instrument has a shift-share structure, as in Bartik
(1991). Several different inference methods can computed, as specified by
\code{method}.
}
\section{Note}{

\code{subset} is evaluated in the same way as variables in \code{formula},
that is first in \code{data} and then in the environment of \code{formula}.

## Use ADH data from Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013)
ivBartik(d_sh_empl ~ 1 | shock, W=ADH$W, Xs=ADH$sec$X, data=ADH$reg,
         method=c("ehw", "akm", "akm0"), residual_sector=TRUE)
